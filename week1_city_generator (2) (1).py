# # MDST 3D Generative Pipeline — Week 1
# 
# ## Goal for this week
# 
# Build the very first version of our procedural city generator, from scratch:
# 
# 1. **Flat terrain** (no hills, water, or archetypes yet — that comes later)
# 2. **Basic building placement** — one downtown center, density-based
# 3. **Green space** — parks filling in empty ground
# 4. A **preview** showing terrain height, building height, and land use side by side
# 
# By the end of this notebook, running all cells should produce a city that looks
# something like a simple downtown surrounded by open ground and scattered parks.
# 
# **How this notebook works:** most cells have a function with a `# TODO` and a
# `YOUR CODE HERE` line for you to fill in. Read the docstring and the hints in
# the comments — they tell you exactly what the line should compute. After each
# one, run the "check yourself" cell right below it — it'll tell you if your
# implementation looks right before you move on.
# 
# Don't worry about making this fast or elegant. Getting it *correct* and
# *understood* is the whole point this week — we'll build on this every week
# after.


# ## Setup
# 
# Nothing to fill in here — just imports and a couple of constants we'll reuse throughout.


import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# grid size: our city is a SIZE x SIZE grid of cells. 128 is a good default --
# big enough to look like a real city, small enough to be fast to work with.
SIZE = 128

# land_use codes -- every cell in the grid is exactly one of these.
# (We'll add ROAD as a 4th code in a future week -- not yet!)
LAND_EMPTY = 0
LAND_BUILDING = 1
LAND_GREEN = 2

print(f"Grid size: {SIZE}x{SIZE} = {SIZE*SIZE} cells")

# ## Step 1: Terrain (flat)
# 
# Every city in our generator sits on a terrain **heightmap** — a `SIZE x SIZE`
# array of elevation values. This week we only build the `flat` terrain type, so
# this is the simplest possible version: mostly level ground with a *little*
# gentle texture so it doesn't look robotically perfect.
# 
# Later weeks will add hills, mountains, rivers, coastlines, and more — but the
# heightmap idea stays exactly the same. Getting this right now means later
# weeks are just "swap in a fancier formula," not "start over."
# 


def generate_flat_terrain(size, seed=None):
    """
    Returns a (size, size) float32 array of terrain heights, roughly flat
    but with a little gentle random texture.

    TODO: create terrain_height as small random noise centered near zero.

    Hint:
        rng.normal(size=(size, size)) gives you random values roughly in
        the range -3 to 3. We want our terrain to stay CLOSE to flat, so
        scale that noise down a lot -- try multiplying by something small
        like 0.05.
    """
    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)

    terrain_height = rng.normal(size=(size, size)) * 0.05

    return terrain_height.astype(np.float32)

# --- check yourself ---
_test = generate_flat_terrain(SIZE, seed=0)
assert _test.shape == (SIZE, SIZE), f"expected shape ({SIZE},{SIZE}), got {_test.shape}"
assert _test.dtype == np.float32, f"expected float32, got {_test.dtype}"
assert abs(_test.mean()) < 0.5, "terrain should stay close to flat (mean near 0) -- is your noise scaled down enough?"
assert _test.std() > 0.001, "terrain has no texture at all -- did you forget to add the noise?"
print("Looks good! terrain_height mean =", round(_test.mean(), 4), " std =", round(_test.std(), 4))

# ## Step 2: Building placement
# 
# Now let's place buildings. This week's version: **one downtown center**, with
# buildings more likely the closer a cell is to that center (a "monocentric"
# layout, in the language we'll use in later weeks).
# 
# The core idea:
# 1. Compute how far every cell is from the center point.
# 2. Turn that distance into an **intensity** — high near the center, decaying
#    outward.
# 3. For each cell, roll a random number; if it's less than
#    `intensity * density`, that cell becomes a building.
# 
# This distance-based-probability trick is the same idea we'll reuse for city
# archetypes, clustering, and more in later weeks — you're building a real,
# reusable piece of the final pipeline right now, not throwaway code.
# 


def generate_buildings(size, density=0.5, seed=None):
    """

# 
# Parks and green space should fill in some of the ground that's NOT already a
# building — we don't want parks overlapping buildings.

# ## Try it yourself
# 
# Now that everything runs, play with it:
# 
# - Change `density` in `generate_buildings(...)` (try `0.2` vs `0.9`) — how
#   does the downtown change?
# - Change `green_amount` in `add_green_space(...)`.
# - Change `SEED` to get a different random layout each time.
# - Try changing `k=5` inside your `intensity` formula (Step 2) — what happens
#   with `k=2`? With `k=15`?
# 
# ## What's coming in later weeks
# 
# This week was deliberately narrow so everyone gets a working result on day
# one. Coming up:
# 
# - Multiple terrain types (hills, mountains, coastlines, rivers, peninsulas)
# - City archetypes (polycentric, linear) and multiple building clusters
# - Roads (with realistic gaps, not a perfect grid)
# - Exporting all of this into real 3D geometry in Blender
# - A trained model that reads a plain-English description and picks all of
#   these parameters automatically
# 
# Everything you wrote today — the heightmap idea, the distance-based
# intensity trick, the land-use grid — is the same core structure the final
# pipeline uses. Later weeks add more parameters and more archetypes, but you
# already understand the foundation.
